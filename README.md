[Vercel Deploy Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAJ6LyvW_cw).
Anyway I have a lot of trouble with this (I've tried to use heroku first), because this isn't a create react app. I had to change vercel configurations so I can use dist/index.html as Â¿'entry point'? I dont know, the thing is that when i do ```npm run production``` the bundle is generated in /dist/index.html and because of that you need to set up /dist/ as root directory.
